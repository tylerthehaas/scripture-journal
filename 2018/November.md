## Significance of the crucifixion

Today I woke up to this tweet:

[Jesus Died in public tweet](https://twitter.com/_lovelike_jesus/status/1062087155957284869?s=21)

for some reason it got me thinking about what purpose the crucifixion even has and how it seems like that part didn't even need to happen. Jesus needed to atone for our sins and be resurrected so we all could return to Heavenly Father. The crucifixion wasn't required for either of those things to happen. And that thought really pissed me off. It wasn't so hard to take when I thought there was a purpose to it but if there wasn't then it just seemed like a bunch of evil dudes doing unspeakable things to the greatest man to ever live just to satisfy their blood thirsty egos. 

I took this thought to our elders quorum slack channel and Brother Jonathan Brehms referenced [this](https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/volume-14-number-1-2013/crucifixion-reclamation-cross) white paper that someone at BYU wrote on the significance of the crucifixion. 

### The Crucifixion: Reclamation of the Cross

> “When we crucify criminals the most frequented roads are chosen, where the greatest number of people can look and be seized by this fear. For every punishment has less to do with the offence than with the example.”

The jews paraded Jesus in front of the masses to show their power but it wouldn't have been possible unless Christ allowed himself to be subjected to them. Great display of humility by Jesus here. I like the irony here. The punishment was for the jews to show people what happens when you go against mans law but Jesus defied that and became the example that The Father would have Him be.

Matthew 27:32

> "And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross."

Who is Simon? I have never heard of him. How long did he carry his cross for? I always thought Jesus carried his own cross.

1 Corinthians 1:18, 22–23

> “For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God... For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness”

1 Corinthians 15:3–4

> “For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures” 

I think there is something from these scriptures I am missing. I think that the only reason the crucifixion is mentioned here is because its how he died which couples it pretty tightly with the resurrection which is obviously extremely important. But Pauls letter to the corinthians seems to be saying something different I just dont yet understand what.

> As we have already noted, it is certainly true that many people were crucified in antiquity. At another time, however, Elder McConkie also taught, “All of the anguish, all of the sorrow, and all of the suffering of Gethsemane recurred during the final three hours on the cross, the hours when darkness covered the land. Truly there was no sorrow like unto his sorrow, and no anguish and pain like unto that which bore in with such intensity upon him.” [30] This reality suggests that Christ’s Crucifixion was unlike any other’s experience. Elder Neal A. Maxwell reminds us of “the axis of agony which was Gethsemane and Calvary.” [31] Thus Paul taught the Romans that “we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son . . . by whom we have now received the atonement” (Romans 5:10–11).

Definitely new found appreciation for the crucifixion. Christ went through the pain and sorrow experienced in the history of mankind twice! Once in the garden of gethsemene and once on the cross. TWICE!!! That blows my mind. Clearly the crucifixion was just as important to the atonement as the garden of gethsemene.

## Significance of the crucifixion continued

Today Brother Alan Stout mentioned a few scriptures that were very impactful to me.

> Tyler, I think these verses are relevant and might help address your question on the necessity of Christ's suffering and violent death:

> "For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea, all are fallen and are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made.

> "For it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast, neither of any manner of fowl; for it shall not be a human sacrifice; but it must be an infinite and eternal sacrifice. ...

> "[T]here can be nothing which is short of an infinite atonement which will suffice for the sins of the world.

> "Therefore, it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice, and then shall there be, or it is expedient there should be, a stop to the shedding of blood; then shall the law of Moses be fulfilled; yea, it shall be all fulfilled, every jot and tittle, and none shall have passed away.

> "And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal.

> "And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance.

> "And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety" (Alma 34:9–16).

> Christ's sacrifice—not a death by natural causes—was absolutely essential to satisfy the demands of justice, and it was the catalyst by which mercy has claim upon us. Only through the suffering and death of a God can we activate faith to motivate us to repent of our sins.

> Further, we learn in Moses—in language that should be familiar to us—of the necessity of the Savior's death:

> "And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me.

> "And then the angel spake, saying: This ... is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, [who] is full of grace and truth.

> "Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore" (5:6–8).

This is really powerful. I've heard/read those verses in Alma probably a thousand times or more and they've never had quite the impact they are having now. I've always thought of the atonement as taking place almost solely in the Garden of Gethsemene. But just as so many literally killed the first of their flock as a sacrifice. Only the Savior being killed, him being our God could have satisfied the requirements of justice. The other thing that strikes me about this is that its the "bowels of mercy" that "overpower justice". Which brings my mind to how Christ didn't transfer ownership of the sin from us to Him. He did however pay the price that justice required for us to enable forgiveness. In other words we commited the sin and the atonement doesn't change that but the mercy of our Heavenly Father overcomes the requirements of justice through the sacrifice given of our Lord. I am feeling a great sense of gratitude and love for the price he paid to forgive my debt. I have so many thoughts going through my mind. I think of the parable of the man who is in debt and cannot pay and is about to be thrown in jail except for a wealthy third party stepping in to pay the price for him and immediately forgives his debt. This also has me thinking what can I do to show my appreciation. I think the only thing Christ cares about is the well being of those he loves. How can I increase my generosity? How can I give more of my time and talents to help Christ bring more of those he loves and has sacrificed so much for into his fold. I don't know the answers to these things but I do know that He has given direction through the scriptures and latter day prophets. If I can follow their direction it'll help me do the things that I am looking to do in order to show gratitude for His sacrifice. CRAZY!! This whole process of searching through these things has been super rewarding.
